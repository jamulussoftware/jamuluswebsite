### Realtek High Definition Audio

Note that the "Stereo input" is really a virtual microphone that
corresponds to the sound being played into the speakers/headphones, it
must be turned off in ASIO4ALL.

### Realtek High Definition Audio with SPDIF subdevices

Similar to the previous, but there are more subdevices (corresponding
to different types of physical audio jacks).

### Intel SST with Realtek(R) Audio

The Realtek device again has a "Stereo input" virtual microphone.  We
need two screenshots to see all of the active devices expanded.

### High Definition Audio device
This one is simple, since there's only one choice for each of input
and output.

### Conexant ISST

Conexant's "Stereo mix" is similar to Realtek "Stereo input".
