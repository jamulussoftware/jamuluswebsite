You can of course use Jamulus with your computer's built-in sound card or microphone.
{: .doubletextsize .blue }

However, most people use external devices like USB microphones or audio interfaces. These usually perform much better than "stock" hardware in terms of audio quality, latency and time needed to set them up. Most are quite inexpensive and are "plug and play".

## Updating this page

Just [edit this page and wait for an approval](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamuluswebsite/edit/release/_posts/2021-01-05-Jamulus-Sound-Devices.md). Please indicate the platform(s) you are using.

## Audio devices known to work with Jamulus

**NOTE** the device must have a sample rate of *48 kHz (DVD quality)* - which many devices do.

Additionally, it should _allow you to listen to the computer‚Äôs audio signal_. [See this explanation](https://jamulus.io/wiki/FAQ#why-should-i-not-listen-to-my-own-signal). This may or may not be significant depending on the instrument you play.
 
On Windows, it‚Äôs recommended to choose a device with a *native ASIO driver* - not ASIO4ALL (or other generic ASIO drivers).

### Key

‚úÖ  Works reasonably well with Jamulus and lets you [turn monitoring off](https://jamulus.io/wiki/FAQ#why-should-i-not-listen-to-my-own-signal) (if applicable). You might need to set up some things, but sound quality and latency are fine.

üòê  - Works, but there might be some difficulties. If you want to buy a new device, don't buy this one.

‚ùå  - Will not work correctly, or does **not** allow you to [turn monitoring off](https://jamulus.io/wiki/FAQ#why-should-i-not-listen-to-my-own-signal) so will cause problems.

‚ùì  - Not yet rated. If you own this device and test it, feel free add to the results here.

**Windows**: üòê Doesn't work great with [ASIO4ALL](http://www.asio4all.org/). Behringer withdrew support for a [native driver](http://www.behringerdownload.de/_software/BEHRINGER_2902_X64_2.8.40.zip) a while ago, and removed it from their download section.

**macOS**: ‚úÖ Works better than on Windows.

**Linux**: ‚úÖ Works better than on Windows.

**Note:** Ploytec, a German company have developed a very low latency alternative to ASIO4ALL and the native Behringer driver for both Windows and Mac. It is capable of latency in the 2 ms range. Their software driver is somewhat expensive at $60, but you can download and try it out to see if it is worth the money for your situation. The demo download can be found at:
[on usb-audio.com](https://www.usb-audio.com/download/)

***

**[Behringer UMC202HD](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0BJZ)**, **UMC204HD**, and **UMC404HD** USB digital audio interfaces. Affordable. Behringer provides native ASIO drivers for Windows.

**Windows**: ‚úÖ Works great. Get the Behringer ASIO driver from [Behringer's website](https://www.behringer.com) under "Downloads".

**macOS**: ‚úÖ Works great (measured interface latency with Oblique Audio RTL Utility, 48000 64 samples and cable from output to input on Mac OS X Big Sur: `10.625 ms`. Note this is **only the interface latency** not the latency in Jamulus)

**Linux**: ‚úÖ Works great (measured interface latency of UMC202HD with `alsa_delay hw:1 hw:1 48000 64 2` and cable from output to microphone input on Debian 10: `8.451 ms`. Note this is **only the interface latency** not the latency in Jamulus)

**Linux**: ‚ùì Not yet tested.

***

**[Roland TD-27](https://www.roland.com/uk/products/td-27/)** USB drum sound module 

**Windows**: ‚úÖ Works. Because the local master signal is always routed to the HeadphoneJack it's neccessary to change the signal-routing to hear your jamulus signal on the headphones and not the local signal of the drum modul. (Explanation: Search for "The Golden Rule" in the jamulus documentation):
Configuration Changes: On the TD27 open: SYSTEM -> USB-AUDIO: Driver Mode VENDOR
                                         SYSTEM -> OUTPUT -> PAD MAS: remove any pad signal from MASTER(L+R);
                                                             PAD DIR: add desired(all) pad signals to DIRECT(1/2)
                                                             OTHER MAS: remove any signal and add just USB-IN to MASTER(L/R)
                       In Jamulus set Audio-Device: TD27, Input Channel: Direct(1/2), output Channel: Main(1/2).
Now the Jamulus signal will be send to the master output jack of the TD27. (You probably need a headphone amplifier to connect you headphones to the master output jack) 

**macOS**: ‚ùì Not yet tested.

**Linux**: ‚ùì Not yet tested.
