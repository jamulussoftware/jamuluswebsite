# Privacy Statement

## Definition of Terms

- "**Server**" The Jamulus Server software, as opposed to the host machine/OS it is running on.
- "**Client**" The Jamulus software used to connect to a Server
- "**Directory**" A Jamulus Server configured to supply a list of Servers to Clients

## Web site

The website at [jamulus.io](https://jamulus.io) is served using GitHub Pages. We do not collect your personal data or set tracking cookies. When you connect to the jamulus.io site, your IP is sent to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Jamulus Software

### Use of Profile Information

When you connect to a Server, whatever you put in My Profile (in Settings) will be shown to others on that Server while you are connected to it. The Server does not otherwise store or record your Profile information and the Server operator has no access to it unless they are also connected as using a Client.

When you connect to a Server, your profile may also be available to third parties from the Directory to which that Server is registered. This can be for informational purposes about the status of the public Jamulus network (for example, [here](https://explorer.jamulus.io/)), but may not be limited to that. Profile information is not otherwise logged or stored by the Jamulus Server you are connected to, or by the Jamulus Directory, but may be stored or processed by third parties.

### Use of IP Addresses

When you connect to Server, the Server operator can see your IP address while you are connected.  If the Server operator has enabled logging (which is off by default) your IP address will also be logged and stored in the Server's log file.

The IP addresses of all Servers registered with the Directory can also be seen by third parties for informational or other purposes (for example [here](https://explorer.jamulus.io/)). Your public IP address is otherwise not logged or stored by Jamulus, but may be stored or processed by third parties.

### Audio Recordings

You will see a notice if you are connected to a Jamulus Server when Server recording is turned on. Recordings of each player are stored by the Server separately as .WAV files and only the Server operator has access to them unless they choose to make them available to third parties.

### Text Chat

When you type a message in the Chat Window, other connected players can see that, but chats are not stored by the Server and neither the Server operator nor any third parties have access to them.

### Data Transmission

Please note that all audio and text data is sent and received between the Jamulus Server and Client without encryption.
