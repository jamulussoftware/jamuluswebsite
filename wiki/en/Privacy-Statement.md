# Privacy Statement

**The English version of this document represents the official privacy statement for the _current version_ of the software available on this website. Earlier versions of the software and non-English translations of this privacy policy may have different terms that are no longer applicable or supported.**
 

## Definition of Terms

- "**Server**" The Jamulus software running as a Server and accepting connections from Clients
- "**Client**" The Jamulus software used to connect to a Server
- "**Directory**" A Jamulus Server configured to supply a list of Servers to Clients

## Jamulus.io Website

The website at [jamulus.io](https://jamulus.io) is served using GitHub Pages. The Jamulus team has not constructed the website to set tracking cookies, but see Github's [privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for information relating to data collection and privacy overall. 

## Jamulus Software

Jamulus is open source software that can be modified by anyone. As such, the Jamulus project can make no representations related to privacy, data collection, or security with respect to your use of the software.

## General Information

Under normal use with software downloaded from this website that has not been modified, your user profile information is exchanged with Servers you connect to, peers connected to those same Servers, and to third parties (including Directories) that use the Jamulus protocol. This information is limited to your Jamulus name, city, country, instrument, and skill level as you have set them in your profile. The Servers you connect to will also have access to your internet address (IP Address) as it is required for the software to work; but this information is not shared with peers on the same Server or available to third parties.

All communications between and among Clients, Servers, Directories, and third-party protocol users are sent without encryption.

## Jamulus Servers

When you connect to a Server, either directly or through a Directory, the operator of that Server is responsible for its operation policy, privacy policy, and data use policy. While unmodified Servers do not log or store your connection or profile information by default, some Servers may be configured to do so. Therefore, you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to your profile information or internet address.

## Chat Exchanges

Chats are textual messages that can be exchanged between Clients connected to the same Server. Everyone connected to a Server can see all chats and there should be no expectation of privacy with respect to information sent through the chat feature of Jamulus. While unmodified Servers do not log or store chats, some modified Servers may do this.

## Audio Recordings

Unmodified Servers will display a notice if recording is turned on. Recordings of each channel are stored by the Server and are controlled by the Server operator.

It is possible for connected Clients to make recordings of sessions outside of Jamulus itself, for which there may be no notice or indication. Jamulus has no way to detect or control these situations and makes no representations as to the collection or use of such recording data.

## Directories

Directories are central connection points for locating Servers. The Jamulus Client comes with a pre-defined list of Directories for the convenience of users. These Directories are independently operated but are represented as running unmodified versions of the Jamulus software. If you do not wish to send your information to the Directories, you will need to connect to Servers directly.
