# Installation for iOS

Make sure you've already read the [Getting Started](Getting-Started) page.

## Things to note about iOS
Although Jamulus on iOS works quite well on new devices if everything is set up correctly, we strongly recommend only doing so if you have an audio interface and an USB-Ethernet adapter. To connect both devices to your iOS device, you should use something like the [Lightning to USB Camera Adapter](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MD821ZM/A/lightning-to-usb-camera-adapter) and a (powered USB-hub).
If you have don't own a PC, we suggest you to buy a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } which is an inexpensive and small device that performs very well with Jamulus. iOS support is just a proof of concept and needs certain skills.

## Install the iOS PoC (for experienced users only)

**Attention:** in order to install Jamulus on your device, you must run macOS. Also - if you don't pay for a apple developer account, Jamulus will only run for at most 7 days on your device.
If you do want to try Jamulus on iOS:

1. Install XCode from the AppStore
1. Connect your device to your Mac
1. [Compile Jamulus for iOS](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/blob/master/COMPILING.md#ios)

## Feedback and development

iOS support isn't mature yet and far from ready to be published on the AppStore. Feel free to help out:
Just head over to the [Jamulus GitHub repo](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/).

Please also read the [APPLEAPPSTORE.LICENCE.WAIVER](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/blob/master/APPLEAPPSTORE.LICENCE.WAIVER) concerning Jamulus being published via the Apple AppStore.
