# Installation for Android

Make sure you've already read the [Getting Started](Getting-Started) page.

## Things to note about Android

Although you **can** install Jamulus on Android devices (and hear sound), we strongly recommend **not** doing so. Sound quality - especially over WiFi - is usually bad and latency is high. If you have don't own a PC, we suggest you to buy a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } which is an inexpensive and small device that performs very well with Jamulus. Android support is just a proof of concept.

## Install the Android PoC

If you do want to try Jamulus on Android:

1. Allow the installation of apps from unknown sources (look in Settings>Security. Note: The exact way to do this depends on your device and OS-version)
1. [Download and install Jamulus]({{ site.download_root_link }}{{ site.download_file_names.android }}){: .button}
1. You should now be able to run Jamulus on your Android device

## Feedback and development

We are very happy to get feedback from Android users and developers. Just head over to the [Jamulus GitHub repo](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/).
