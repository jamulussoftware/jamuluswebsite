     <h2>Jamulus worldwide</h2>
    All over the world Jamulus allows huge choirs to rehearse, loud rock bands to play, and brings folk and classical musicians together. It's being used for remote music lessons,
    in schools and universities, in private and in public. Even just for the spoken word – all in real time on the Internet, as if you were there in person.
