infobox_each_os:     'Jamulus 3.9.1 addresses a MIDI controller-related bug that could result in the loss of old fader levels: If you used `--ctrlmidich`, you can start the app once with `--cleanuplegacyfadersettings` to try to convert the old format to the new one. This option will be removed in a future release. Read the <a href="https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/blob/main/ChangeLog">Change Log</a> for more information.'
