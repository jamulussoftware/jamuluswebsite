# Contributing to the Jamulus Project

If you find a mistake, typo or something out of date (in any language) on this website or in Jamulus itself, you can <a href="https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/issues">raise it as a bug</a>.

If you think some documentation or information is missing or can be improved, <a href="https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/discussions">post about it on this forum</a> so it can be discussed first.

We use [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/jamulus/#languages) to translate our documentation. Read about our [documentation and translation process](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamuluswebsite/blob/release/README.md), and [introduce yourself](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/discussions) if youâ€™d like to get involved.
