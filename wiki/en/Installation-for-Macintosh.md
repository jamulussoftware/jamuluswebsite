# Installation for macOS

Make sure you've already read the [Getting Started](Getting-Started) page.

Upgrading? You may want to [back up your configuration](Software-Manual#backing-up-jamulus) first.

1. [Download Jamulus (Universal build)]({{ site.download_root_link }}{{ site.download_file_names.mac }}){: .button}\\
 **Mirror 2:** [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/llcon/files/latest/download)
1. **Install Jamulus**: Open the downloaded `.dmg` file, agree to the licence, *drag and drop* each icon you see in the window (Jamulus Client and Server) into your *Applications folder*. After that, you can close this window.
1. **Run Jamulus**. Now you should be able to use Jamulus just like any other application.

_You can remove the folder in the Downloads directory containing the `.dmg` and eject the "Jamulus" drive on your desktop. They are no longer needed._

**Note:** You can find old (legacy) versions supporting outdated operating systems on the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/releases).
