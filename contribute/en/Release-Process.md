# Release Process for Jamulus

This document lists the exact steps required for a developer with write access to generate either a pre-release (beta, rc) or full release of Jamulus.
Note: Besides the actual build, a full release of Jamulus should also follow the release checklist which can be copied below. This is to ensure a good release quality.
## Release (Building)
### Once to set up

A direct clone of the Jamulus repo is required, not a fork. This should be set up in a separate directory just for the release process:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jamulussoftware/jamulus.git jamulus-upstream
$ cd jamulus-upstream
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:jamulussoftware/jamulus.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:jamulussoftware/jamulus.git (push)
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### Steps for a specific release

#### 1. Ensure .ts files are up to date

First make sure all Pull Requests that should be included in the release have been merged in Github.

Next, change to the above directory `jamulus-upstream`, checkout `master` and ensure it is up to date:

```
$ cd jamulus-upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git status
```

Make sure there are no pending changes shown by `git status`.

Now update the `.ts` files to reflect the latest version of source code:

```
$ lupdate Jamulus.pro
$ git status
```

It should list all the `.ts` files that have been updated. If there are any, they should be committed directly:

```
$ git commit -am'Update .ts files for <version>'
$ git push
```

#### 2. Notify all the translators that translation is required

This could be done via Github and/or Discord. Maybe by creating an issue for each language and assigning the issue
to the translator.

#### 3. Update the .ts files returned by translators

Each translator should submit a PR containing just their new version of the `.ts` file. There is no need to submit
a new `.qm` file, as they will all be regenerated below.

A developer should check and merge each PR as it arrives.

#### 4. When all translations have been submitted and merged.

Change to the above directory `jamulus-upstream`, checkout `master` and ensure it is up to date:

```
$ cd jamulus-upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git status
```

Make sure there are no pending changes shown by `git status`.

Now ensure the compiled translation files are up to date:

```
$ lrelease Jamulus.pro
$ git status
```

If any of the `.qm` files have been updated by `lrelease`, they will be shown as changed files. If there are any, they should be committed and pushed:

```
$ git commit -am'Update compiled translations'
$ git push
```

Next edit both `Jamulus.pro` and `ChangeLog` with the new version number, such as **3.7.0rc2** or **3.7.0**:

```
$ vim -o Jamulus.pro ChangeLog
```

In `Jamulus.pro`, edit the `VERSION` line to give the release, e.g.

```
VERSION = 3.7.0rc2
```

or

```
VERSION = 3.7.0
```

In `ChangeLog`, for a pre-release, change the first version heading as follows:

```
### 3.7.0rc2 <- NOTE: the release version number will be 3.7.0 ###
```

for a proper release, change it as follows, removing the NOTE and including the release date:

```
### 3.7.0 (2021-03-17) ###
```

Check only those two files have changed, then commit and push the changes:

```
$ git status
$ git commit -am'Update version to 3.7.0 for release'
$ git push
```

Now add the required tag locally and then push the tag. This will start the automated release process on Github:

```
$ git tag r3_7_0
$ git push origin tag r3_7_0
```

### If this is a proper release, move the `latest` tag

This needs the `--force` option to overwrite the existing `latest` tag and move it to the current commit:

```
$ git tag --force latest
$ git push --force origin tag latest
```

For a pre-release, the `latest` tag should not be updated, but continue to point to the last proper release.

### Make the master branch ready for post-release development

This can be done immediately after pushing the above tag, there is no need to wait.

Edit both `Jamulus.pro` and `ChangeLog` to add `dev` to the version number and create a new section in the change log:

```
$ vim -o Jamulus.pro ChangeLog
```

In `Jamulus.pro`, edit the `VERSION` line to add `dev` to the current version number, e.g.

```
VERSION = 3.7.0dev
```

In `ChangeLog`, add a new section with `dev` and restore the NOTE indicating the next version number:

```
### 3.7.0dev <- NOTE: the release version number will be 3.7.1 ###


### 3.7.0 (2021-03-17) ###
```

Check only those two files have changed, then commit and push the changes:

```
$ git status
$ git commit -am'Set version to 3.7.0dev'
$ git push
```

Close the shell or change out of the upstream directory to one's usual working directory, e.g.:

```
$ cd ../jamulus
```

## Release checklist (for a full release)
Before starting a full release process, an issue in the jamulussoftware/jamulus repository needs to be opened. The content of this issue should include the following checklist:

~~~
---
name: 'For maintainers: Release a new version'
about: This is the Developer-only template which we use for tracking the process of future releases.
title: 'Prepare Release 3.y.z'
labels: release
assignees: ''
---

**Target timeline**
Scheduled feature freeze / Start of translation process: <!-- Add a date, usually about 6-8 weeks from the last release, e.g. 2021-04-20 -->
Targeted translation completion date: <!-- E.g. two weeks after feature freeze, e.g. 2021-05-04 -->
Approximate release date: <!-- E.g. one week after targeted translation completion date to have time for late translations, reviews, RC, e.g. 2021-05-11 -->
Current state: <!-- Planning|Translations (beta)|Code freeze (rc)|Released -->

  - [ ] Check if all merged Pull Requests on the jamulussoftware/jamulus repository which needed documentation have been documented and everything is in sync
  - [ ] Check for conflicts between the `release` and `next-release` branch (e.g. by opening a Pull Request from `release` to `next-release`)
  - [ ] Open a Pull Request from `next-release` to release, set it as "Draft" and briefly scan the changes for typos or errors in the English version
  - [ ] Declare a full freeze of the `next-release` and `release` branch. No changes should be made from now on to ensure translators don't have to work twice.
  - [ ] Check if the list of translators in `tools/create-translation-issues.sh` is up-to-date
  - [ ] Create a translation Issue for each language, e.g. `../jamulus/tools/create-translation-issues.sh 3.8.0 2021-05-15 web 'Note: The term "Central server" has been replaced with "Directory server"'` (Last argument is optional and should be skipped if there is nothing to add)

- [ ] Start App translations
  - [ ] Generate `.ts` files in master via `lupdate`
  - [ ] Check if the list of translators in `tools/create-translation-issues.sh` is up-to-date
  - [ ] Create a translation Issue for each language, e.g. `./tools/create-translation-issues.sh 3.8.0 2021-05-15 'Note: The term "Central server" has been replaced with "Directory server"'` (Last argument is optional and should be skipped if there is nothing to add)

- [ ] Finish App translations
  - [ ] Review PRs <details><summary>Checklist for the PRs</summary> <!-- FIXME: This should be moved to the admin wiki and linked here -->
     ```
     - [ ] Translator listed in the `src/util.cpp` **optionally add link to PR or code**
     - [ ] Punctuation and spacing consistent
     - [ ] Signal words consistent ("ASIO", "Buffer")
     - [ ] App translations: No untranslated strings (`grep unfinished -5 src/res/translation/translation_$TRANSLATION*.ts`)
     - [ ] App translations: Only a single `.ts` file checked in (`.qm` in addition is also OK)
