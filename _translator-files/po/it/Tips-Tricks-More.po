msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../wiki/en/Tips-Tricks-More.md:86
msgid "The volume fader, pan control and mute and solo buttons in the Client's mixer window strips can be controlled using a MIDI controller by using the `--ctrlmidich` parameter (note: only available for use with macOS and Linux using Jamulus version 3.7.0 or higher, and on Windows using the Jamulus version with JACK support). To enable this feature, Jamulus must be launched with `--ctrlmidich`. There is one global MIDI channel parameter (1-16) and two parameters you can set for each item controlled: `offset` and `consecutive CC numbers`. Set the first parameter to the channel you want Jamulus to listen on (0 for all channels) and then specify the items you want to control (f = volume fader; p = pan; m = mute; s = solo; o = mute myself) with the offset (CC number to start from) and number of consecutive CC numbers. There is one exception that does not require establishing consecutive CC numbers which is the \"Mute Myself\" command - it only requires a single CC number as it is only applied to one's own audio stream. Take the following example:"

This means that when pressed to 'turn on' a control, it must send a MIDI CC number with a value >=64, and to 'turn off' the control it must send the same CC number with a value <64. You can read your controller's manual to find out how to set this.\n"

Continuing with the above example, in strip number 1 (farthest left), the volume fader would be controlled by CC number 0; pan by 16; solo by 32 and mute by 48. As we have specified 8 consecutive controllers for each parameter, this would give us MIDI control over 8 strips (volume, pan, solo and mute in each one) in the mixer window. The next strip would be controlled by 1, 17, 33 and 49, and so forth."

In order to keep the fader strips following a numerical order, go to \"View\" on the top menu bar and switch between \"No User Sorting\" and another option and then back again (e.g. type `Ctrl+N`, `Ctrl+O`).\n"
