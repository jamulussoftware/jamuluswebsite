"No. Musicians on a Jamulus server simply play in real time time together as "
"they would in person. If you want to have a time signal, then there are "
"shared metronome solutions on the Internet you can try, but it’s probably "
"best to just minimise latency so nobody has an overall delay more than about "
"30-50ms."

"In general, if somebody sets up a public server they accept that anyone can "

"Whether or not you will be able to play in time with other musicians depends "
"mainly on how much latency (delay) you have in your sound signal. An overall "
"delay much bigger than 50ms usually makes it too hard to play in time unless "
"you train yourself to do so. Some musicians report they can play in time "
"with delays of up to 70ms by playing ahead of the beat. But much beyond that "
"and it becomes too difficult unless timing isn’t an important factor in the "
"music."

"So it makes sense to minimise any sources of delay or other problems with "
"the signal. Even fast wi-fi is usually too variable to use for long periods "
"with Jamulus, and Bluetooth headphones and mics usually introduce latencies "
"of about 50ms or more."

"For the same reason as you need to minimise delay in your signal in order to "
"play in time, you need to make sure you are playing to your own sound that "

"Of course, if you are playing an acoustic instrument, or are a singer, it "

"do so by for example using closed-back headphones turned up as loud as you "
"are able to mask your own sound. This will let you concentrate on the mix "

"Normally, network address translation (NAT) firewalls prevent incoming "
"requests initiated from outside the local network. Inbound traffic is only "
"possible for packets relating to an outbound request (strictly speaking, "
"“related” and “established” packets to an initial outbound connection). In "
"public server mode, when your Jamulus server connects to a Directory Server "
"it of course initiates an outbound connection. From then on, the Directory "
"Server sends (established/related) connection “pings” (not ICMP pings) to "
"your server at regular intervals to keep the relevant NAT port(s) open on "
"your router/firewall."
