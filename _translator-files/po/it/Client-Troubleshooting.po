Make sure no other applications like your browser, video conferencing tool etc. is also using your sound card. You should shut those down when using Jamulus. If that all looks OK and the problem persists, it's likely there's an issue with your sound device settings. This will depend on your particular setup (platform, hardware, software and drivers), so it's best to ask on [the forums](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/discussions) for guidance."

This signal has you and your playing partners mixed together in sync, and will be the signal that your bandmates are hearing too. So listening to that means you will be in sync with each other (assuming you all have reasonably low latency).
