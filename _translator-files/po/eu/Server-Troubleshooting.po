msgid "Some ISPs use techniques like [Address plus Port (A+P)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_plus_Port) or [Carrier-grade NAT (CGN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT) to conserve address space (usually for IPv4). That makes it impossible to host services like Jamulus at home as they are not visible outside your local network."

msgid "To detect if CGN is the issue, go to your router's configuration screen (typically, 192.168.X.X) and look at the WAN Status page. If your listed IPv4 address doesn't match with your public IPv4 address (check it [here](https://ifconfig.me)), it suggests that CGN may be enabled. You can try using an IPv6 connection by starting clients and server with the `-6` flag if IPv6 is available for the server and all clients."

msgid "To fix the issue with IPv4, contact your ISP technical support team, and tell them that you want to host a public server at home, so you need a real WAN IP address. Furthermore, you can help them with info that CGN might be the issue. Also, you can ask for a static IP address to avoid using DDNS."
