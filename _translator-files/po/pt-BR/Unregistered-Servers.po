You might want to associate your IP address with a domain name you can share with others that uses \"dynamic DNS\" (DDNS). A \"dynamic DNS\" provider can supply you with the domain name and you keep refreshing your IP address with the provider. Your router might support certain DDNS providers to do this. If this is not the case, the provider will have instructions on how to set up a dynamic DNS client."

msgid "Jamulus Clients support [DNS SRV records (\"service\" records)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record). If a Client finds an SRV record associated with the domain name given in the Connect window, it will try to connect to the endpoint host and port listed in the SRV record. This process is similar to HTTP redirection in a web browser, only it's between Jamulus Clients and the DNS server. The Jamulus Server is not involved in this interaction. Jamulus Servers just listen for connections on the same port listed in the SRV record."
