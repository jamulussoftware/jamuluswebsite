This makes it impossible to host services like Jamulus at home (and may mean you also cannot see server lists in your client, or you may be missing [some specific servers](https://sourceforge.net/p/llcon/discussion/server/thread/f72b293af0/))."

If your listed IPv4 address does not match with the address you see [here](https://ifconfig.me), then this means CGN may be enabled. Or if you experience problems such as being unable to [connect to servers or an empty server list](https://sourceforge.net/p/llcon/discussion/533517/thread/b3eea395c4/) this may also be an indicator that your ISP is the problem too."

msgid "To fix the issue: if you are running a public server, try [port forwarding](Running-a-Server#port-forwarding). If you are running a private server and are port forwarding already, contact your ISP support and request them to remove you from CGN and assign you a real WAN IP address because you want to host a server. If CGN is not the issue, you may need to ask your ISP to give you a WAN IP address (or fixed one to avoid using DDNS, if possible). If all else fails, consider hosting on a cloud platform (some providers do free trial periods)."
