msgid "The volume fader, pan control and mute and solo buttons in the client's mixer window strips can be controlled using a MIDI controller by using the `--ctrlmidich` parameter (note: only available for use with macOS and Linux using Jamulus version 3.7.0 or higher). To enable this feature, Jamulus must be launched with `--ctrlmidich`. There is one global MIDI channel parameter (1-16) and two parameters you can set for each item controlled: `offset` and `consecutive CC numbers`. Set the first parameter to the channel you want Jamulus to listen on (0 for all channels) and then specify the items you want to control (f = volume fader; p = pan; m = mute; s = solo) with the offset (CC number to start from) and number of consecutive CC numbers. Take the following example:"

Continuing with the above example, in strip number 1 (farthest left), the volume fader would be controlled by CC number 0; pan by 16; solo by 32 and mute by 48. As we have specified 8 consecutive controllers for each parameter, this would give us MIDI control over 8 strips (volume, pan, solo and mute in each one) in the mixer window. The next strip would be controlled by 1, 17, 33 and 49, and so forth."
