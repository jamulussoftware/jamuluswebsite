This is necessary to allow Clients on the public Internet to connect to them via NAT. Note that for the Servers using this option, you will still need proper port forwarding in your router/firewall."

This does not mean that Clients connected to those Servers will be disconnected, but does mean that new Clients will be not able to see Servers listed by your Directory until those Servers reconnect. To enable the list of registered Servers to persist between restarts, use the `--directoryfile` option to specify the location and name of a file that the Directory can read and write to."
