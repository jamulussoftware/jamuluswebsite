With this path set, the \"Enable Jam Recoder\" function in the Server Setup tab will make recording start once the first person connects to the Server, and stops when the last person leaves. Use the \"New Recording\" button to create a new sub-directory in which the recordings will be stored from then on. Note that Recordings are per track in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) `.lof` format and [REAPER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REAPER) `.rpp`. Open the respective files to listen to them in those applications."
