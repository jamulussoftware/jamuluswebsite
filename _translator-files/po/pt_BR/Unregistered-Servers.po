You might want to set up \"dynamic DNS\" to get a static address you can share with others. A \"dynamic DNS\" provider can supply you with a static IP address that you can share, but you need to keep refreshing your dynamic IP with the provider. Your router might support certain providers to do this. If this is not the case, the provider will have instructions on how to set up a dynamic DNS client."
