If you want to have a time signal, then there are shared metronome solutions on the Internet you can try.

msgid "Whether or not you will be able to play in time with other musicians depends mainly on how much latency (delay) you have in your sound signal and whether you are all following [The Golden Rule](/wiki/Client-Troubleshooting#you-all-sound-ok-but-its-difficult-to-keep-together). An overall delay much bigger than 50 ms usually makes it too hard to play in time unless you train yourself to do so. Some musicians report they can play in time with delays of up to 70 ms by playing ahead of the beat. But much beyond that and it becomes too difficult unless timing isn’t an important factor in the music or you just want to listen."

#. type: Plain text
#: ../wiki/en/FAQ.md:40
msgid "So it makes sense to minimise any sources of delay or other problems with the signal. Even fast wi-fi is usually too variable to use for long periods with Jamulus, and Bluetooth headphones and mics usually introduce latencies of about 50 ms or more."

But you should at least try to do so by for example using closed-back headphones turned up as loud as you are able to mask your own sound. This will let you concentrate on the mix coming back to you from the Server."

msgid "Normally, network address translation (NAT) firewalls prevent incoming requests initiated from outside the local network. Inbound traffic is only possible for packets relating to an outbound request (strictly speaking, “related” and “established” packets to an initial outbound connection). In Registered Server mode, when your Jamulus Server connects to a Directory it of course initiates an outbound connection. From then on, the Directory sends (established/related) connection “pings” (not ICMP pings) to your Server at regular intervals to keep the relevant NAT port(s) open on your router/firewall."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../wiki/en/FAQ.md:73
msgid "However, to reach an Unregistered Server, each Client has to **initiate** a connection into the Server’s network. A NAT firewall prevents this, so you need to configure the firewall to allow incoming connection requests on the Jamulus port using port forwarding."
