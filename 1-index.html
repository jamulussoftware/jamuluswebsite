      <h2>What is Jamulus?</h2>
       Jamulus is for playing, rehearsing, or just jamming with your friends, your band or just anyone you find online. With high quality, low-latency sound on a normal broadband connection, it's easy to play together remotely and in time.

     <h2>Jamulus worldwide</h2>
    All over the world Jamulus allows huge choirs to rehearse, loud rock bands to play, and brings folk and classical musicians together. It's being used for remote music lessons,
    in schools and universities, in private and in public. Even just for the spoken word – all in real time on the Internet, as if you were there in person.
